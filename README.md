# TaskDataMax
The ide of project is to not use predefined functions
I choose to work with list beacause is more simple to  add an  emelent in the exact plase without deleting others.
#1. I  create  a for loop to  create a string with concatonate number whitch i use it in  the #2 .
#2. I created a another for lopp to create a list with in order numbers form  the string i created
#3. I created a third for lopp to get  each  string input number  into  a second list
#4. I created a last one lopp to  compare each  element and to  add (0) for  non existing element.
